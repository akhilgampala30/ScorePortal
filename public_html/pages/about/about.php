            A Message From the Team:

            We the ScorePortal development team believe in the power of data to enhance our everyday lives,
            so when we realized that online student information services are providing so much detailed grade
            information that could be used more effectively, we decided to take action.
            That’s why our founder, Mike Shi, created ScorePortal, and also why the members of our team decided to join
            the project.<br>
            In the brief period that ScoresPlus, the former version of ScorePortal, was accessible to the public,
            the website received immensely positive feedback and became the dominant tool for students to analyze
            grades online.<br>
            Now the website, rebranded as ScorePortal, continues to serve hundreds of students in the AUSD with
            functions we never thought possible.<br>
            The project now involves seven active members (you can see us below) working through all the free time
            allotted in these busy high school years.<br>
            We hope to deliver through our work a new form of online interactive transcripts and to help students
            excel in their studies.

                        Hi I’m Michael Shi, the project leader for ScorePortal. I handle all site and project operations
                        but I work more with the coding of the site.
                        I’ve coded several programs and websites and have a large repository of projects on my disk that
                        await to be brushed off and completed.
                        I enjoy coding in both web settings and I started dedicating a good portion of my time to coding
                        when I was twelve years old.
                        During free time when I'm not coding I’m just wandering through Pandora stations to find good
                        music while I’m doing my work or chatting with people.

                        Hello! I'm Jacky, and I handle the team's day to day operations as well as codes. In spite of my
                        efforts to change my title in the team, I couldn't, so I'm now known as the D.O.T.
                        I watch plenty of movies and am an avid Sherlock fan. I also do a lot of Computer Graphics
                        design in my spare time.

                        program some years ago,
                        I have enjoyed doing so occasionally in my free time. During the rest of it, the activities I
                        have done range from playing piano to Wikipedia-binging.
