            <dt>What is ScorePortal?</dt>
            <dd>ScorePortal is a website that allows you to do all kinds of useful stuff with your grades data. You can
                visualize, project, and analyze your grades in ways PowerSchool doesn't offer.
            </dd>
            <dt>How is my data obtained?</dt>
            <dd>After setting up your account with your PowerSchool login, we use an API provided by PowerSchool to
                retrieve your data.
            </dd>
            <dt>Is my data safe?</dt>
            <dd>All of the information sent through our servers is protected through SSL. All information stored on our
                servers is encrypted by AES, an encryption standard approved by National Security Agency to store even
                the TOP SECRET level information in the government. So yes, your data is safe.
            </dd>
            <dt>Will my data be sold or transferred to anybody?</dt>
            <dd>No - besides the fact that exploiting sensitive data would be unlawful and/or unethical, we do not take
                part in these practices
            </dd>
            <dt>Why donâ€™t my assignments have averages/percentiles?</dt>
            <dd>This simply means ScorePortal does not have the minimum amount of assignments required to calculate the
                statistics with any reasonable accuracy, so ask your friends to join!
            </dd>
            <a style="display: block; position:relative; top: -66px; visibility: hidden;" id="whyAds"></a>
            <dt>Why does ScorePortal place ads?</dt>
            <dd>ScorePortal is completely student run - we are not funded by investors, and currently we are paying for
                all
                the expenses of the website by ourselves.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                Placing advertisement spots helps us to even out the costs and also give us the opportunity to support
                the organizations,
                student run or not, that we love and endorse.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                To request ad placements, please email us at
                <a href="mailto:ads@scoreportal.org">ads@scoreportal.org</a>,
                and we'll work with you to maximize your advertisement coverage.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                Note: Students and student organizations enjoy special discounts!
            </dd>
            <dt>I saw more features on your Facebook screenshots than I see here. Why?</dt>
            <dd>At ScorePortal we test and retest everything to ensure they are working before we release them. So worry
                not! Those features will be coming in the next month or two!
            </dd>
            <dt>Who's behind ScorePortal?</dt>
